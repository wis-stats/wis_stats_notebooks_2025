        "In @exr-censored-and-truncated, we considered censored distributions in the context of a distribution describing an assay measuring mice descending poles. In a paper investigating the effects of gut microbiota on motor activity, ([Morais, et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.18.629251)) Morais and coworkers performed exactly this experiment. The data are available [here in a CSV file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bebi103.caltech.edu/data/morais_pole_and_beam.csv) that I extracted from the [publicly available Excel file with the data](https://github.com/jdthoang/LHMorais2024/blob/main/Data/GFxSPF_ASO/MotorBehaviordata_GFSPF_Livia_111323.xlsx). Note that the data set is not tidy, so you may wish to tidy it before using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the data set, there are four conditions. WT-GF (wild type, germ free gut), ASO-GF (\u03b1-synuclein-overexpressing, germ free gut), WT-SPF (wild type, specific pathogen free), and ASO-SPF (\u03b1-synuclein-overexpressing, specific pathogen free). The SPF condition is standard laboratory practice, where the GF condition features a cleared gut. For each condition there are nine mice, each with three trials.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to build a hierarchical model for the pole descent times of the mice for each condition and infer the pertinent parameters about their descent times."
