[Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037) investigated the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, the switching of a microtubule from a growing to a shrinking state. In particular, they were interested in the time between the start of growth of a microtubule and the catastrophe event. They monitored microtubules by using tubulin (the monomer that comprises a microtubule) that was labeled with a fluorescent marker. As a control to make sure that fluorescent labels and exposure to laser light did not affect the microtubule dynamics, they performed a similar experiment using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. They measured the time until catastrophe with labeled and unlabeled tubulin.\n",

        "**b)** Write a function, `ecdfvals_expr(col)`, that returns a Polars `Expression` that will compute the `y` values of an ECDF for a given column, `col`. Again, assume there are no NaNs in the column.\n",

        "**c)** Use either the `ecdfvals()` function or the ecdfvals_expr() function that you wrote to plot the ECDFs shown in Fig. 2a of the Gardner, Zanic, et al. paper. By looking this plot, do you think that the fluorescent labeling makes a difference in the onset of catastrophe? (We will do a more careful statistical inference later in the workshop, but for now, does it pass the eye test? Eye tests are an important part of EDA.)
