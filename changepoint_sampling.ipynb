The retina is exposed to constant light, but at some time between the start and end of the experience, the impinging light intensity changes. That is, for $0 \\le t < s$, the retina is exposed to one light intensity, and for $s \\le t \\le T$, it is exposed to another. The problem is that you do not know what $s$ is, and you have to infer it. Your task is to construct a Bayesian model for this situation, complete with prior predictive checks.\n",

If you can analytically marginalize out the changepoint $s$, you may then be able to sample the other parameters and then after sampling compute the marginal distribution for $s$. It may be useful to use the following integral for $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \\cdots < t_n < T$, where $\\theta(x)$ denotes a Heaviside step function.\n",
