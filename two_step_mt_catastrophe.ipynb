    "**a)** In the [Gardner, Zanic, et al. paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037), the authors assumed that the microtubule catatrophe times are Gamma distributed. Discuss how the story behind the Gamma distribution might work for modeling microtubule catastrophe.\n",

    "**b)** As an alternative model, we assert that two biochemical processes have to happen in succession to trigger catastrophe. That is, the first process happens, and only after the first process happens can the second one happen. We model each of the two process as a Poisson process (as is very often done with (bio)chemical dynamics). The rate of arrivals for the first one is $\\beta_1$ and the rate of arrivals for the second one is $\\beta_2$. Show that the PDF of the distribution matching this story is \n",

Chemical processes are often modeled as Poisson processes, and one can imagine that it may take several successive chemical processes to trigger a catastrophe event. If these processes all have similar rates, the time to catastrophe could be approximately Gamma distributed."
