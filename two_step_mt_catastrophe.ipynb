        "**b)** As an alternative model, we assert that two biochemical processes have to happen in succession to trigger catastrophe. That is, the first process happens, and only after the first process happens can the second one happen. We model each of the two process as a Poisson process (as is very often done with (bio)chemical dynamics). The rate of arrivals for the first one is $\\beta_1$ and the rate of arrivals for the second one is $\\beta_2$. Show that the PDF of the distribution matching this story is \n",
