        "> Larvae were raised on a 14/10 h light/dark (LD) cycle at 28.5\u00b0C. On the fourth day of development, single larva were placed in each of 80 wells of a 96-well plate (7701-1651; Whatman, Clifton, NJ), which allowed simultaneous tracking of each larva and prevented the larvae from interfering with the activity of each other. Locomotor activity was monitored for several days using an automated video-tracking system (Videotrack; ViewPoint Life Sciences, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) with a Dinion one-third inch Monochrome camera (model LTC0385; Bosch, Fairport, NY) fitted with a fixed-angle megapixel lens (M5018-MP; Computar) and infrared filter, and the movement of each larva was recorded using Videotrack quantization mode. The 96-well plate and camera were housed inside a custom-modified Zebrabox (ViewPoint Life Sciences) that was continuously illuminated with infrared lights and was illuminated with white lights from 9:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M. The 96-well plate was housed in a chamber filled with circulating water to maintain a constant temperature of 28.5\u00b0C. The Videotrack threshold parameters for detection were matched to visual observation of the locomotion of single larva. The Videotrack quantization parameters were set as follows: detection threshold, 40; burst (threshold for very large movement), 25; freeze (threshold for no movement), 4; bin size, 60 s. The data were further analyzed using custom PERL software and Visual Basic Macros for Microsoft (Seattle, WA) Excel. Any 1 min bin with zero detectable movement was considered 1 min of rest because this duration of inactivity was correlated with an increased arousal threshold; a rest bout was defined as a continuous string of rest minutes. Sleep latency was defined as the length of time from lights out to the start of the first rest bout. An active minute was defined as a 1 min bin with any detectable activity. An active bout was considered any continuous stretch of 1 min bins with detectable movement.\n",

        "After performing an experiment with larvae, DNA is extracted from the larvae and sent to sequencing so the genotype of the fish in each well may be determined. The genotype data is then hand-entered into a spreadsheet and saved as a text file.\n",

        "The data you will work with in this homework come from a paper by Grigorios Oikonomou (a staff scientist in the Prober lab). This data set was a set of early measurements that led him and his colleagues toward understanding how tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) affect sleep patterns ([Neuron, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.038)). To understand the experiment, you can watch the [video abstract of the paper](https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.05.038/attachment/bec5ed0b-0b38-4319-af8c-e397824c57e7/mmc3.mp4).

        "To understand the quantitative measurements in this data set, it is important to know how the measurements are made. Images are acquired at a rate of 15 frames per second. Lights were off from 11 PM to 9 AM and on from 9 AM to 11 PM. The image is divided into 96 regions of interest (ROIs), one for each well in the 96-well plate. The detection threshold is a number between zero and 255. If a pixel changes its intensity by more than the *detection threshold* from one frame to the next, the pixel is considered to have changed between frames. If the total number of pixels in an ROI that have changed between frames is less than the *freeze threshold*, the fish is considered to be \"frozen,\" or not moving. If the total number of pixels that have changed between frames is greater than the *burst threshold*, the fish is considered to have undergone a \"burst,\" or rapid movement. If the number of pixels that changed is between the freeze and burst threshold, then the fish is said to have \"middle movement,\" meaning that it is moving, but not moving violently.\n",

        "Here are some useful comments on the content of the data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The `'location'` column contains the number of the well preceded by the letter `'c'`.\n",
        "2. The `'animal'` column is redundant; the same information is contained in the `'location'` column.\n",
        "3. The `'user'` column is the account on the controlling computer. It is not used in the analysis.\n",
        "4. The `'sn'` and `'an'` columns are not used.\n",
        "4. Each row of the data set refers to a minute of video data acquisition. The `start` and `end` columns give the time from the beginning of the experiment of the measurement. The `stdate` and `sttime` give the start date and time according to the clocks in Pasadena.\n",
        "5. The columns `'frect'`, `'fredur'`, `'midct'`, `'middur'`, `'burct'`, and `'burdur'` contain information about the fish's activity per minute of observation. The prefixes `fre`, `mid`, and `bur` refer respectively to freeze, middle, and burst. The suffixes `ct` and `dur` refer to count and duration. The counts are the number of events observed in a given time interval. So, `burct` is the number of bursts observed in the time interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on discussion I have had with Grigorios, he recommends considering moving vs. non-moving fish, meaning that the distinction between burst and middle movement is not very important, and summing `burdur` and `middur` is an appropriate metric for fish activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you are performing EDA, think about what quantities to describe sleep that you want to compute from the data. You might look at Fig. 1 from the paper for ideas, but you can also come up with your own. This is the most important part of data exploration/dashboarding. Think carefully about it, and you should discuss thoroughly with your teammates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Big hint:** Though tidy, there is a fair amount of wrangling that needs to be done to get the data frame in a workable format, particularly because of the time series. The `load_activity()` function below will allow you do load in the data frame and automatically do some wrangling to get the data frame in a workable format. Be sure you understand what it does and how it does it."
