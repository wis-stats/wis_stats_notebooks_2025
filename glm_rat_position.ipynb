        "Consider an experiment where a rat moves back and forth along a linear maze. A spike train is recorded from a neuron in the hippocampus, as well as the rat's position along the maze. Your task is to develop a GLM that connects the position of the rat in the maze to the spiking rate. Perform inference to get posterior distributions and/or MAP estimates of the parameters."
